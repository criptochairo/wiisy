            <h1>The <i>What if I Say Yes</i> Person of the Month</h1> <br /><br />

            Here I want to share with you the stories of the people I have met who perfectly exemplify what I mean by the "What if I Say Yes!" philosophy.
            <br /><br />
            You will meet men and women who, at different times in their lives, have dared to say yes! and have started very interesting projects.
            <br /><br />
            They are the people who inspire me to keep going and the ones who remind me that life is worth living.
            <br /><br />
            I hope this space inspires you to express the best of yourself in the different areas of your interest.
            <br /><br />
            Good luck!
