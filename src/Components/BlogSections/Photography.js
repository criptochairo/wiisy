            <p class="content-text">

                In December 2020, I <b>started taking photographs</b> during my daily outdoor walks. It was my way of relieving stress after several months, mostly indoors at home during the beginnings of the pandemic. Taking photos made me <b>observe</b> more closely what nature has to offer. <br /><br />I started <b>seeing</b> things in new ways. I took my time to breathe, process, and enjoy life by looking at and being with nature.<br /><br />

                And then one day, I thought, what if I start sharing my photos with those I love? And not only that, what if I could create a playful experience for them? And so I shared my pictures with them and a special descriptive and creative caption.    
                <br /><br />
                In this photography blog, you will see what I have seen and shared since and also get a chance to read the captions I came up with. 
                <br /><br />
                I hope to inspire you to start seeing your world from a different lensâ€¦ one that is more attentive, patient, loving and understanding. 
                <br /><br />
                If you do that, I can assure you will start feeling better about your own life.
                <br /><br />

                <i>January 11, 2022</i> <br /><br />


                I took more than 500 photographs on my daily walks. Over time I improved my eye and my attention to detail. I began to see with the eyes of a photographer and then when I saw something beautiful in nature, I immediately framed it in my mind, even before taking out the phone to use the camera. <br/><br/>
                
                My photos from the beginning are interesting but are missing something. <br/><br/>
                
                The last ones I like a lot and since it seems that the people with whom I shared them also liked them, we decided that one day we are going to offer them here, on this website, in a little store.<br/><br/>

                The idea is that whoever likes my photographs can buy and download them as a digital file and then use them however they want.<br/><br/>

                I will tell you here how we are progressing with this project.<br/><br/>
                
                In the meantime, here is a sample of what I photographed from December 13, 2020, to December 13, 2021:<br/><br/><br/><br/>
            

                <div className="post-img-container">

                    <img src={Three} alt="postimg" />
