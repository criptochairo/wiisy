                On December 2020, I <b>started taking photographs</b> during my daily walks outside. It was my way of processing my stress after several months at home because of the pandemic. Taking photos made me <b>observe</b> more closely what nature has to offer. I started <b>seeing</b> in a way I hadn't before. I took my time to breathe, process, and enjoy life by looking at and being with nature.<br /><br />

                And then one day, I thought, what if I start sharing my photos with the people I love? And not only that. I wanted to create a playful experience, so I shared my pictures with a special caption.
                <br /><br />
                In this blog, you will see what I have seen since then and read the captions I came up with. 
                <br /><br />
                I hope to inspire you to start seeing your world from a different lensâ€¦ one that is more attentive, patient, loving and understanding. 
                <br /><br />
                If you do that, I can assure you will start feeling better about your own life.
