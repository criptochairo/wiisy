                In December 2020, I <b>started taking photographs</b> during my daily outdoor walks. It was my way of relieving stress after several months, mostly indoors at home during the beginnings of the pandemic. Taking photos made me <b>observe</b> more closely what nature has to offer. <br /><br />I started <b>seeing</b> things in new ways. I took my time to breathe, process, and enjoy life by looking at and being with nature.<br /><br />

                And then one day, I thought, what if I start sharing my photos with those I love? And not only that, what if I could create a playful experience for them? And so I shared my pictures with them and a special descriptive and creative caption.    
                <br /><br />
                In this photography blog, you will see what I have seen and shared since and also get a chance to read the captions I came up with. 
                <br /><br />
                I hope to inspire you to start seeing your world from a different lensâ€¦ one that is more attentive, patient, loving and understanding. 
                <br /><br />
                If you do that, I can assure you will start feeling better about your own life.
                <br /><br /><br /><br />
