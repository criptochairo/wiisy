            One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that I found new ways to get close to my daughter Maya. For several months, being together all day was a challenge ... until one day, we discovered that we could create things together.
            <br /><br />
            In the summer of 2021, several of her cousins graduated from junior high and senior high school. To celebrate them from a distance, we made a video with a significant character in Maya's life named Cookies.
            <br /><br />
            My brother HÃ©ctor gave her a teddy bear the day she was born. He came to the hospital and brought a pink plastic bracelet that said, "It's a girl!" and a beautiful teddy bear that Maya later baptized as <b>Cookies</b> (yes, like that, in plural).
            <br /><br />
            Cookies' video was so successful that we decided to continue making and sharing more of them to celebrate someone's birthday or to entertain younger friends.
            <br /><br />
            We will share some of the videos we created together (Maya, Cookies and I) in this section.
            <br /><br />
            I hope it inspires you to collaborate with someone else and create visual projects to share them with the world too!

            <br /><br />
            Maya and I have been very busy lately and this month we only had time to take a photo with Cookies.<br /><br />

            Cookies has been very busy because she went on tour, ha-ha!<br /><br />

            But hey, we hope to have a new video (in Spanish and English) to share with you very soon.<br /><br />
