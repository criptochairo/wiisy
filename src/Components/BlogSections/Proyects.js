            <h1>My Daughter's Proyects With Me</h1> <br />

            One of the positive effects of the pandemic was that I found new ways to get close to my daughter. Being together all day, all week, all month and for several months was a challenge ... until one day we discovered that we could create things together.
            <br /><br />
            In the summer of 2021, several of her cousins were going to graduate from junior high and high school and to celebrate from a distance we made a video with a very important character in Maya's life: Cookies.
            <br /><br />
            It is a teddy bear that my brother Héctor gave her the day she was born. He came to the hospital and brought a pink plastic bracelet that said "It’s a girl!" and a beautiful teddy bear that Maya later baptized as Cookies (yes, like that, in plural).
            <br /><br />
            The video was so successful that we decided to continue making and sharing Cookies videos to celebrate someone's birthday or to entertain little friends.
            <br /><br />
            In this space we will share some of the videos that we have created together (Maya, Cookies and me).
            <br /><br />
            I hope it inspires you to create visual projects and share them with the world.
