            One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that I found new ways to get close to my daughter. For several months, being together all day was a challenge ... until one day, we discovered that we could create things together.
            <br /><br />
            In the summer of 2021, several of her cousins graduated from junior high and high school. We made a video with a significant character in Maya's life: Cookies.
            <br /><br />
            My brother Héctor gave her a teddy bear the day she was born. He came to the hospital and brought a pink plastic bracelet that said, "It’s a girl!" and a beautiful teddy bear that Maya later baptized as <b>Cookies</b> (yes, like that, in plural).
            <br /><br />
            The video was so successful that we decided to continue making and sharing Cookies' videos to celebrate someone's birthday or to entertain younger friends.
            <br /><br />
            We will share some of the videos we created together (Maya, Cookies and I) in this space.
            <br /><br />
            I hope it inspires you to collaborate with someone else and create visual projects to share them with the world.
