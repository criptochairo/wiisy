            My daughter Maya and my husband Carlos will oversee this section. 
            <br /><br />
            They wanted to participate in my website, and I said <b><i>yes!</i></b> <span role="img" aria-label="smile">ðŸ˜„</span>
            <br /><br />
            Here they will talk about a moment of the week that was critical, fun, interesting, curious, etc., for them.
            <br /><br />
            It is a space to encourage you to reflect on how you lived the past week by choosing a moment you want to remember forever.
            <br /><br />
            Maya and Carlos hope that you will like what they share with you.
