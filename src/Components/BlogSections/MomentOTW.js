            My daughter Maya and my husband Carlos will oversee this section. 
            <br /><br />
            They wanted to participate in my website, and I said <b><i>yes!</i></b> <span role="img" aria-label="smile">ðŸ˜„</span>
            <br /><br />
            Here they will talk about a moment of the month that was critical, fun, interesting, curious, etc., for them.
            <br /><br />
            It is a space to encourage you to reflect on how you lived the past month by choosing a moment you want to remember forever.
            <br /><br />
            Maya and Carlos hope that you will like what they share with you.

            As the photos show, Maya and I finally and officially explored our respective musical instruments!  What does this mean? Well, she picked up my guitar and I picked up her violin and we both played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" (Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125) separately with the other's help.
            <br /><br />
            I served as her first guitar teacher and she was my first violin teacher.  What a moment!  Maya was amazing, playing not only this piece but others with such fluidity.  And she told me I was a quick learner too with the violin. So, for our first moment of the week, we share our musicality!
