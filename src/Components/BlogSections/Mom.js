            <h1>My Mom's Recommendations</h1> <br />

            My mom dedicated much of her life to raising 3 sons and 2 daughters, and then helping raise her 3 granddaughters and 3 grandsons. The time she had left for herself was minimal and yet she always found a way to keep her curiosity for learning.
            <br /><br />
            Now that we are no longer living at her home and she can enjoy her time more freely, she has a huge collection of recommendations on books, movies, documentaries, places, etc.
            <br /><br />
            In this space I want to share her recommendations with you, to honor all that institutional memory that she has built in her more than 70 trips around the sun.
            <br /><br />
            Hopefully this space will encourage you to turn to the people you have spent a lifetime with and engage in conversations about the things they have learned in the course of their lives.
