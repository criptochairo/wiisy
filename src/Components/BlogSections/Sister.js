            <h1>My Sister's Advice</h1> <br />

            The most important woman in my life, after my mother, is my sister Rocío.
            <br /><br />
            She is older than me and therefore has had to open the path so that when I have to go through, life is less difficult for me.
            <br /><br />
            She takes care of me from a distance, loves me unconditionally and has taught me to live life in a lighter way.
            <br /><br />
            When I have had difficult moments, it is she who I consult.
            <br /><br />
            And just as there is the famous Dear Abby column (Dear Abby - Wikipedia), on this site I want to create a similar section but with my sister being the one who gives advice and guides readers, just as she has advised and guided me.
            <br /><br />
            This space is intended to be a fun place to listen, learn, and consider a new perspective.
            <br /><br />
            Rocío and I hope you enjoy it.
            <br /><br /><br /><br />
