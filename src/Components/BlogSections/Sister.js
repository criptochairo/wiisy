            <p class="content-text">
            The most important woman in my life, after my mother, is my sister RocÃ­o.
            <br /><br />
            She is older and has opened many paths to make life less complicated for me when I go throught it.
            <br /><br />
            She takes care of me from a distance, loves me unconditionally, and has taught me to live life more lightly.
            <br /><br />
            When I have had difficult moments, it is she who I consult (besides my dearest husband, of course).
            <br /><br />
            And just as there is the famous <b><i>Dear Abby</i></b> column (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Abby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >Dear Abby - Wikipedia</a>), I wanted to create a similar section where my sister gives advice and guides readers, just as she has advised and guided me.
            <br /><br />
            This space is intended to be fun while we learn and consider a new perspective.
            <br /><br />
            RocÃ­o and I hope you enjoy it.
            <br /><br />

            <i>This month, my sister has <b>Tips for Dancing:</b></i>
                <br /><br />
                Have fun!!
                <br /><br />
                It's always nice to see someone dancing who is having fun, even if they seem to have no style.
                <br /><br />
                In fact, this reminds me a lot of my brother HÃ©ctor, ha-ha. His movements were very funny, but he had fun and we had fun watching him.
                <br /><br />
                And if you like a particular type of dance, take classes! Practice always helps ðŸ˜‰.
