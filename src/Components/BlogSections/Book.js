            <h1>My Book With my Twin Brother</h1> <br />

            My twin brother and I turned 50 this summer (2021) and to celebrate in a big way it occurred to me that we could create a book together and publish it through Amazon. Without editorials involved and without depending on someone telling us if they liked our project or not.
            <br /><br />
            I consulted with my brother, and he said yes (See? He paid attention to the process of "what if I say yes?")
            <br /><br />
            Many years ago, Jorge found in painting a way to fall in love again with life and with his being, after having gone through very painful moments. And since then, he has created works of art that make those who see them fall in love.
            <br /><br />
            And if that wasn't enough, a few years ago he created his own website to promote Mexican artists (you must visit www.pintoresmexicanos.com to see what I'm talking about ... it's a beauty!)
            <br /><br />
            Well, our idea is to choose his best 50 works of art (painting, drawing and sculpture) and combine them with my best 50 photographs ... but since I have not yet completed a year of starting taking photos and I want to register the change of the 4 seasons of the place where I live, we are going to wait for December 13 to arrive (which is also Saint Lucia's day, that is, my patron saint) and then we will begin the process.
            <br /><br />
            Jorge will design the book and I will write the text and together we will publish in 2022 a work that I hope you like as much as we already do.
            <br /><br />
            The idea is to inspire you to do the same: self-publishing is a way to bring out our most sincere and deepest thoughts and share them with the world.
            <br /><br />
            Here I will tell you about our creative process and update you on our progress...
