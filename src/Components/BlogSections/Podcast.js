                One day, reflecting with my husband and daughter about the meaning of my life, and answering their questions, I concluded that I wanted to try something new that made me very nervous but at the same time excited me enormously: to create my podcast. 
                <br /><br />
                Thanks to the pandemic, I had started listening to many podcasts and had fallen in love with this personal form of communication.
                <br /><br />
                Now the question was... And what do I make my podcast about? What do I have to offer to the world?
                <br /><br />
                It turns out that I have been gifting words to my family, dear friends, and people I have wanted to pamper for many years. But I have not published those writings; I have not shared them with anyone other than the people to whom they are dedicated.
                <br /><br />
                So, I thought, "what if I do it about gifts and words?"
                <br /><br />
                Thus, the title and my podcast were born.
                <br /><br />
                The logo was designed for me by my twin brother. My oldest brother is the sound director. My sister-in-law helped me train my voice. And my daughter recorded the podcast presentation.
                <br /><br />
                My mother tongue is Spanish, so I record it in Spanish. I still haven't gotten myself into saying <i>what if I say yes to recording it in English?</i> That still scares me (my pronunciation isn't perfect, and I'm afraid I will end up saying something that sounds like something else, haha). But in the spirit of this website, I will be announcing that I will present my podcast in English one day.
                <br /><br />
                In the meantime, I will write here about what I talk about in my various episodes, to inspire you to do the same: learn to give away your own words and who knows? Maybe also create your podcast.
