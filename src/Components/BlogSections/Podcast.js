                <p class="content-text">

                One day, reflecting with my husband and daughter about the meaning of my life and answering their questions, I concluded that I wanted to try something new that made me very nervous but at the same time excited; that is, to create my podcast. 
                <br /><br />
                Thanks to the pandemic, I had started listening to many podcasts and had fallen in love with this personal form of communication.
                <br /><br />
                Now the question was... And what do I make my podcast about? What do I have to offer to the world?
                <br /><br />
                It turns out that, for many years, I have been gifting words to my family, dear friends, and others I love and admire. Yet I have not published these writings; I have not shared them with anyone other than the people to whom they are dedicated.
                <br /><br />
                So, I thought, "what if I do it about gifts and words?"
                <br /><br />
                Thus, my podcast's title was born: <i>De regalos y palabras</i> (Of Gifts and Words).
                <br /><br />
                The logo was designed for me by my twin brother Jorge. My oldest brother Luis is the sound director. My sister-in-law Ana Laura helped me train my voice. And my daughter Maya recorded the podcast presentation.
                <br /><br />
                My mother tongue is Spanish, so I record it in Spanish. I still haven't gotten myself into saying <i>what if I say yes to recording it in English?</i> That still scares me because my pronunciation isn't perfect, and I'm afraid I will end up saying something that sounds like something else, ha-ha. But in the spirit of this website, I will say <b><i>yes!</i></b> to presenting my podcast in English one day.
                <br /><br />
                In the meantime, I will write here about what I talk about in my various episodes to inspire you to do the same: learn to give away your own words, and who knows, maybe also create your podcast someday!

                    On April 19, 2022 I published <b>Episode #2: Words That Promise</b>. 
                    <br /><br />
                    In this episode, I tell you how and when I met my Carlos, how our relationship evolved, and finally, how we got to our two weddings, the civil and the one we created and held at a restaurant called Rosa Mexicano in New York City.
                    <br /><br />
                    I talk about all these details to give you some context before you hear me reading the marriage vows I wrote to my now-husband.
