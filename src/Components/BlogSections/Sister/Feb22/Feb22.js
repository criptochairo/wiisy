                <br /><br />
                Have fun!!
                <br /><br />
                It's always nice to see someone dancing who is having fun, even if they seem to have no style.
                <br /><br />
                In fact, this reminds me a lot of my brother HÃ©ctor, ha-ha. His movements were very funny, but he had fun and we had fun watching him.
                <br /><br />
                And if you like a particular type of dance, take classes! Practice always helps ðŸ˜‰.
