            <p>
            In matters of creation, it is very important to have a personal, intimate space. But it is also important to create a communal space, to share what we think, reflect, and feel and thus give a more complete meaning to our existence.<br /><br />

            After reflecting on my own, I really like to ask people I know what they think about this or that topic. I feel like I always learn something from someone. It opens me up to new ways of seeing the world.<br /><br />

            This space is for you to share your anecdotes related to your own "what if I say yes" processes. Here you can write about your doubts, tell us about your fears and resistances, but also share the times when that yes! has changed your live, even if it has been in very modest ways.<br /><br />

            So, I leave this blackboard for you to write and share ... <strong>(coming soon).</strong>
